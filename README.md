# Automatic-aerator-system
The Automatic Aerator System with Bluetooth Control is an eco-friendly solution for enhancing aquaculture. Powered by a battery, it boosts dissolved oxygen levels to improve water quality, ensuring healthier aquatic environments. The systemâ€™s Bluetooth connectivity allows users to remotely control and monitor operations via a mobile app.
# Intoduction to the project 
Aquaculture plays a critical role in supporting global food security and providing livelihoods. However, a key challenge in aquaculture is maintaining optimal water quality, especially the levels of dissolved oxygen (DO), which is essential for the survival and growth of aquatic organisms. Insufficient DO can lead to stress, poor growth, or mortality, making aeration systems indispensable in aquaculture management. Traditional aeration systems, while effective, often rely on electricity and manual operations, leading to high energy consumption and limited flexibility. This calls for a sustainable, energy-efficient, and smart solution to address these challenges.
# Features 
1) Real-time Monitoring â€“ Continuously tracks dissolved oxygen levels.
2) Automated Aeration â€“ Activates/deactivates aerators based on threshold values.
3) Remote Access â€“ Control & monitor via a mobile app/web dashboard.
4) Energy Efficient â€“ Optimized operation reduces power consumption.
5) Alerts & Notifications â€“ Notifies users of critical oxygen level changes.
